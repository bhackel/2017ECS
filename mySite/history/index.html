							Neurons in Neural Networks
						</h2>
						<p>
							Even though almost all neural networks are created using computers, their history goes back decades before computers were widespread.
							In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed the first artificial neuron, called the Threshold Logic Unit.
							Fourteen years later, the perceptron algorithm was invented at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt, which outputs a 1 for an input above or equal to zero, and a 0 for an input below zero.
							This was the most basic of neural networks, and became the foundation for future networks.
						</p>

						<h2>
							Convolutional Neural Networks
						</h2>
						<p>
							Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s showed how the visual cortex processes small regions of vision at a time.
							In the 1980s, Kunihiko Fukushima proposed the neocognitron, a hierarchical, multilayered artificial neural network, which was used for pattern recognition in handwriting and other tasks. It served as the inspiration for convolutional neural networks.
							Yann LeCun created LeNet5 in 1994, which was a seven level convolutional network for recognising handwritten digits on checks.
							The network inspired what we have today as it used convolutions and sub-sampling, the same techniques used today.
						</p>

						<h2>
							Recurrent Neural Networks
						</h2>
						<p>
							In 1997, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber invented the Long Short Term Memory network.
							Problems with recurrent neural networks in this time was the amount of CPU and memory needed to process them.
							Around 2007, with more computational power, LSTMs were able to putperform other neural networks in speech recognition.
							LSTMs were later used in improved speech recognition, text to speech, and imitating talking heads.
							LSTMs are in significant use by Google to this day.
